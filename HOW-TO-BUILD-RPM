How to build RPM specfile for codesearch
(Ref: git@github.com:google/codesearch.git)

NOTE: The codesearch.spec file conforms to these
draft packaging guidelines for 'golang' based applications:

  http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/PackagingDrafts/Go

To create the codesearch rpm's, do the following:

1. If necessary, change the git commit id given by
   this line in codesearch.spec:

   %global rev     ffe6c2b91745d75d6c72eecb028f80e8d9469067

   If you change that value, you will likely also
   want to change the 'snapshot' date stamp.

   %global snapshot	   20150617

2. If necessary, change the version number given in lib/version.
   It has the form '#.##', where '#' is a decimal digit.

3. cd into the 'lib' directory and run 'build-rpm'.

   cd lib; ./build-rpm

The rpm spec file will be written to ~/rpmbuild/SPECS/codesearch.spec.

The source rpm can be found under ~/rpmbuild/SRPMS.

The binary rpm for the codesearch tools can be found under
~/rpmbuild/RPMS/<arch>, where <arch> is the computer architecture
(for example, ~/rpmbuild/RPMS/x86_64).

The library rpm for the codesearch tool library routines
can be found under ~/rpmbuild/RPMS/noarch

The rpm's will have names of the following form.

  codesearch-0.20150617-02.fc23.src.rpm
  codesearch-0.20150617-02.fc23.x86_64.rpm
  golang-googlecode-codesearch-devel-0-02.gita45d81b686e8.fc23.noarch.rpm
